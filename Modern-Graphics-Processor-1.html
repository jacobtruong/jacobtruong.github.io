an ambitious concept, its scale and scope pale in comparison to the technology
advances that allowed the conception of the game in first place. One such
revolutionary technology is that of the Modern Graphics Processor.
In the current day and age, people
tend to be unaware of the importance of the Graphics Processor, due to a very
simple fact: they have been seamlessly incorporated into modern electronic
devices. If you use laptops, smartphones or PCs on a daily basis, you will come
to the realisation that one of the most integral parts of the system is the
screen. Simply put, no matter how powerful your hardware might be, without any
visual feedback, it is practically unusable. In order for data to be taken from
the CPU and outputted to a display device, a Graphics Processing Unit – GPU –
is required. 
Their development bloomed in the
1970s, and primarily, they were used for Arcade system boards – in order words,
video games constituted to the creation of the GPUs. 50 years later, in 2020,
gaming is still the focus and the driving force of the Graphics cards
evolution, pushing the boundaries of graphics fidelity. Half a century ago, the
epitome of computer graphics were just dots and simple sprites, but today,
real-time rendering of lifelike character models and indistinguishably detailed
environments are nothing out of the ordinary. Ray Tracing, a commonly used
technique in blockbuster animations to realistically display lighting and
shading used to drive up the rendering time for a single frame to several days,
can now be rendered in real-time in 4K resolution. 
Graphics processing technology can
also be applied in other, non-graphical use cases. For example, using the
parallel computational capability of GPUs, we can run complex calculations and
algorithms in the discipline of Computational Science, developing models to
enable humans to better understand natural systems. Similarly, in the field of
Machine Learning, GPUs are utilised to speed up the training process of Deep
Learning models. Even more surprisingly, GPUs can be used to simulate molecular
structures and protein folding, aiding the effort to cure and find vaccines for
infectious viral diseases, including COVID-19. In summation, graphics
processing technology has evolved far beyond the initial intended purpose,
influencing numerous sectors of Information Technology as well as other fields
and disciplines. 
However, as with any other aspects
of technology, GPUs are still undergoing further innovations and improvements.
In the following years, I reckon a greater extent of transistor size reduction
will lead to higher transistor density on the same processor die area,
increasing processing power and memory bandwidth while enabling manufacturers
like NVIDIA and AMD to lower their product pricing. This will grant future
generations a boon of more accessible and powerful processing resources,
empowering them to learn and experiment with aspects of Information Technology
with much less difficulty. An immediate impact would be seen in the Video Game
industry. Next-gen games with even higher graphic quality and clarity will be
produced, blurring the line between what is conceived as virtual and real. The
size reduction of transistors will open more opportunities in the field of
Internet of Things, as it would allow the manufacture of micro-scale GPUs for
single-board computers and microcontrollers like the Raspberry Pi and Arduino
line-up. These micro-GPUs can help expand the processing capability of these
devices, improving on use cases such as smart home appliances and automated
surveillance systems. Major effects will also be felt on the field of
Artificial Intelligence. With advances in image processing speed and
efficiency, more exciting breakthroughs will be discovered in Computer Vision
technologies such as Object Detection and Distance Estimation, giving rise to a
more intelligent generation of self-driving vehicles and automated machineries.
As previously discussed, GPUs are also used in Deep Learning and neural
networks, therefore further processing enhancement will in turn lead to more
impressive technology, such as real-time image reconstruction, AI-generated
novels and songs, and maybe in the far future, fully functional and cognitive
androids. The enhancement of modern graphics processors will also facilitate progress
in other scientific fields. In particular, in the field of Astronautics, the
improvement in GPUs power could boost the performance in the aspect of
simulating physics, allowing more advanced scientific simulations like
space-flight trajectory to be carried out, supporting research in space
exploration and colonisation. On a more personal scale, I believe better
graphics cards will allow me to better pursue my education and career in the
field of Information Technology. More graphical power would also aid me in
actualising my project idea, <i>An Nam</i>,
by facilitating faster model rendering time and better framerates when
playtesting. 
While the upsides of Modern Graphics
Processor evolution and the by-proxy benefits seem to be uncountable, on the
side of societal effects, employment and careers might be negatively affected.
For example, graphics designers might run out of business when graphics
processing technology coupled with machine learning could create beautiful
artworks by themselves. Computer Vision or any Graphically-related AI
technologies might make redundant careers in logistics (such as drivers) or
manufacturing (assembly and factory workers). This might in turn begin a chain
reaction in laying off human workers in other areas for more efficient and cost
effective technology solutions. 
While the aforementioned impacts of
the development of Modern Graphics Processor might seem overly farfetched,
affecting such a wide range of scientific and societal sectors, it is the
characteristic of technology: everything is interconnected. As graphics
processors are becoming more of a general-purpose processor, it is gradually
becoming the processing cornerstone of all fields in Information Technology,
making it an important technology that should be better focused and taught.<u></u>
