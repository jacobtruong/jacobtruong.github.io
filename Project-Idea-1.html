games foster the mindset that allows creativity to grow</i>.” – Nolan Bushnell.
As technology progresses, conventional art and entertainment fail to keep up,
paving the path for a new medium of storytelling: <b>video games</b>. Since my ideal job is to work in the gaming industry,
for this Project Idea, I am proposing a concept for a third-person
action-adventure video game set in the historical periods of Vietnam with the
use of Unreal Engine, recounting stories of our triumphs and accomplishments,
called <i>An Nam</i>. This project will be
the product of my passion for the field of Information Technology, and my
affection for my country’s cultures and customs.

Industry) is indisputably one of the largest and fastest growing, even
exceeding those of the Film Industry and Digital TV &amp; Video Industry. Despite
such significant economic potential, the industry in Vietnam seems to be
stagnating and lagging behind, concentrating on importing foreign games and
localising them instead of creating meaningful and impactful culture-rich
games. Furthermore, as video games play a fundamental role in the development
of certain technology advancements (for instance the graphics cards), the lack
of large-scale gaming projects in Vietnam might inhibit its people from
exploring this sector of Information Technology. Understanding and endeavouring
to rectify these issues, I want to create <i>An
Nam</i>, a project that could revitalise the game development spirit in the
country while leaving a legacy spreading Vietnamese history and traditions to
foreign lands.

modern third-person, action-adventure games, the development of <i>An Nam</i> will include 3 main features.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br><b>The Narrative</b>:
Great video games have good stories,
but masterpieces require both phenomenal storytelling and plot. <i>An Nam</i> is set in the historical eras of
Vietnam, and you will play as multiple different historical figures as the game
progresses. Currently, I plan to have 3 main protagonists:<!--[if !supportLists]-->
                    <br>- Ngo Quyen: a warlord who ended the thousand-year domination of
Chinese dynasties and founded the kingdom of An Nam.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
                    <br>-&nbsp;Ly Thuong Kiet: a great general of the Ly Dynasty, the author of
the first declaration of independence of Vietnam&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
                    <br>- Tran Hung Dao: a royal prince and great general who repelled two
major Mongol invasions.&nbsp;<br>Generally, the plot structure for
all protagonists will be relatively similar, spanning their birth, adolescent
years, major accomplishments and ultimately, their death. With this structure,
the players will be able to experience the full life of the characters, growing
fond of them gradually, allowing them to immerse in the historical setting more
convincingly. All characters will be voice acted in Vietnamese and subtitled in
different languages, ensuring accessibility for international audiences. The
plot and quest designs will also be written with consultation from historians
to emphasise the customs and characteristics of the Vietnamese people,
fulfilling one of the main objectives of the game: spreading the Vietnamese
heritage to the world.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br><b>The Gameplay:</b> Gameplay mechanics are arguably the
most challenging aspect of game development. In a historically accurate game
like <i>An Nam</i>, the primary combat
system will be melee combat, using a variety of weapons including spears,
staffs, short swords, "daos” and shields. A limited range combat system
using bows and crossbows will also be implemented. A combat skill-tree will not
be used in order to maintain historical accuracy, instead players will unlock
new abilities as the story progresses. Similarly, to remain faithful to factual
events, dialogues will be linear, not branching. While the game is level-based
and not intended to be open-world, each level should be large enough to
encompass the look and feel of the Monarchical period of Vietnam. Within the
confine of these levels, certain traversal mechanics will be in place, such as
carriages and horseback riding, along with exploration opportunities.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br><b>The Technical Aspects:</b> The success of a video game depends on how
immersive it is, and the same principle will be applied to <i>An Nam</i>. In order to maintain the players’ suspension of disbelief,
the game needs to be designed intricately and polished inside out. The most
important aspect when it comes to immersion&nbsp;
is undoubtedly the graphics. Since a detailed game with Vietnamese
characters is rather unprecedented, 3D character models will need to be
designed from scratch using Blender. Environment design and textures will be
taken from archaeological findings, historical documents and still-standing
monuments. All of these details will be incorporated into Unreal Engine to be
assembled for level construction. On the programming department, the game will
have to be coded with care, ensuring a minimal number of bugs and physics
irregularity. Certain subsystems offered by Unreal Engine like Physics and NPC
AI will be utilised to deliver a more entrancing experience. Last but not
least, an often overlooked but equally important aspect is sound design. The
auditory experience in a video game could be the “make or break” factor, and
thus for <i>An Nam</i>, the sound
engineering will have to be carefully catered to. Era-appropriate soundtracks
will be recorded, and as previously stated, voice acting will be done with
Vietnamese voice artists, giving the game another level of ambience.&nbsp;
