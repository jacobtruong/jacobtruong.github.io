I would like to discuss is cybersecurity and privacy. In the Age of
Information, technology is the cornerstone of civilisation itself, and data an
integral part that is almost omnipresent in all aspects of human’s society.
However, as the Internet links everything and everyone together, never before
has sensitive personal and professional information been in such a vulnerable
position, with many prevalent risks of data leak and privacy invasion. Due to
this alarming situation, a branch of Information Technology – Cybersecurity –
emerged, endeavouring to protect computer systems and networks, as well as
people’s data and privacy
In order to better understand the
necessity of Cybersecurity and Privacy protection, we have to explore the
numerous problems of the cyberspace. First, we will take a look at the most
relatable breach of privacy for the average user, and it is about the
information that is collected by websites and services. For example, on
Facebook, you are required to input sensitive details about yourself, such as
your real name, phone number, email, and home address. Next, the company will
automatically collect more nuance types of data like your location, social
habits, preferred news topic, favourite type of entertainment or activities.
Then, they will create a personalised advertisement profile for you, allowing
particular products and services to target you specifically. While this does
not sound like a big deal, over time, Facebook will have collected a sizable
amount of your data and preferences, and these are lucrative targets for
cybercriminals. In case of a security breach, not only would your personal
details be exposed, but so will your behavioural records, enabling the hackers
to use the information for nefarious purposes, ranging from selling them,
blackmailing you with them, to stealing your identity altogether. If these data
fall into the wrong hands, your own personal safety might be endangered. To
make matters worse, almost all major web services employ a similar system and
strategy, and these collected data are traded among these companies. While
statistically speaking, such extreme circumstances are rather infinitesimal, I
think most people would still prefer a zero chance of any of this happening,
over any chance at all. 
Apart from hidden privacy risks from
using online services, users are also very likely to be attacked more directly.
On the more common and less-technical side of cyberattacks is social
engineering, the act of psychologically manipulating people into performing
actions or divulging confidential information. A prime example of this is
Phishing, the act of creating a fraudulent email or website that is almost
identical to a legitimate source, such as a bank statement or a Facebook log-in
website, in an attempt to solicit sensitive info like usernames, passwords and
credit card details. Another well-known tactic is organised phone call scams,
also known as tech support scams. Have you ever surfed the web, and pop-ups
appear stating that your device is now infected with a virus? Usually, a phone
number is included with this notification, claiming to be technicians from
trusted companies like Microsoft. If you call this number, a scammer will pick
up the phone, impersonating professionals claiming that only they can help you
with the problem. Then, they would either require a payment, or leave a
backdoor virus on your device, for further exploit. Moreover, aggressive,
technical attacks aiming at you could also be a possibility. For instance, if
you are a high-profile figure holding confidential company secrets, you are
very likely to be targeted by cybercriminals. They might attempt to brute-force
their way into your account (basically trying to guess your credentials) using
a password dictionary, gain control of your systems through malwares, or to use
multi-vector, polymorphic 5th generation (Gen V) cyberattacks
combining multiple dangerous techniques.
With such a number of
cyber-vulnerabilities, let us explore some of the Cybersecurity techniques and
implementations that would help us retaliate and secure our information. On the
matter of social media privacy issues, unfortunately there are no absolute
solutions. You can try to discontinue the usage of social media, but since it
has become such an integral part of modern life, it is almost impossible to
have a functional personal and professional life without a digital presence.
Therefore, I could only suggest using these platforms for building up your
professional profile, posting less about your daily life while using more
secure applications like Signal for the need of social communication. Regarding
personal tracking and tagging risks, the best method to tackle this is to use a
VPN service such as ExpressVPN or NordVPN. These services will mask and encrypt
your web traffic, allowing you to safely use the internet, at the traded cost
of internet connection speed. To combat social engineering risks, however, it
is entirely depending on us and our cautiousness. Using common sense, we should
be able to discern cloned websites from original ones by looking at the URL and
avoid deceiving pop-ups and notifications. An antivirus like Bitdefender or
Avast is indispensable in protecting your device and data from malwares and
viruses. On the grand scale of corporations, it is generally best to have a
dedicated security firm or department keeping a watchful eye on the sensitive
secrets, always ready to employ countermeasures against cyberattack. As
security is only as strong as the weakest link, employees should also go through
mandatory information security training, minimising human-factor risks in
protecting data.
Gone are the days of being safe in
your own home, as a cyberattack can happen at any moment in time. The need to
safeguard your personal information and secure your rights and freedoms is
higher than ever, and because of this, the field of cybersecurity is on its way
to becoming one of the most important IT fields in the upcoming years, ensuring
a safe and bright future for the Information Age.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><u></u>
