career, if one only focuses on the didactic and refuses to venture beyond the
academics to seek hands-on experience, they are doomed to fail. Wanting to find
out more about the industry that is soon to be my lifelong career, I interviewed
Mr. Phan, a senior software developer at a local software company. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
asked about his job and responsibilities, Mr. Phan replied with a rather
unsurprising answer: he codes. As a software developer, he said, it is his
primary job to sit at his desk and code almost every single day. However, he
added that “coding” is just a hypernym term used to describe multiple different
tasks related to programming. When he is given a fresh task, for instance a new
feature, he has to interpret this request and draw up a rough developing plan
for the most efficient coding progress possible. Only once he has finished
brainstorming, which usually takes half a day, would he begin to write the
first line of code. Then, a cycle, which he humorously dubbed “development
hell”, of coding and debugging begins. He asserted that for a single feature,
this cycle could last days, weeks or even months to be completed, depends on
the number of sub-features required for the scope of the project. An admirable
characteristic of Mr. Phan is that he is what one may call a “fullstack
developer”, a person who could take care of both frontend and backend
development. This means aside from the usual duty of programming, he also
designs user interface elements for his given task. He proclaimed that this
enables him to better control both the look and functionality of the feature,
allowing the program to both be pleasing on the eye and maintain good
performance and efficiency.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
difference between Mr. Phan and most software developers, is that he is in a
senior position, and this expands his capacity into managing other staff
assigned to his team. On a daily basis, apart from coding, he has to give
instructions to and answer questions from junior developers as well as properly
manage his team in order to deliver their allocated task on time. As the team
leader, he is to report to the general project manager, and in certain cases,
he would meet with the clients directly to discuss the feasibility of their
requests. “It is not the most dynamic job in terms of socialising”, he said,
“most of the time you only strictly interact with others for work, so for some
people who prefer more friendly conversations, this might be a downside that
should be taken into consideration before they opt for this line of work.” 
Once asked about the aspect of work
that he spends the most time on, Mr. Phan again redirected my attention to the
programming aspect of the job. “For a developer, coding is as essential as
breathing and drinking”, he reiterated. 70% of the time he spent on work hours
is for coding and debugging, reviewing his team member’s work, and refining
details to optimise the software or feature. 
Rigorous time allocation aside, Mr.
Phan also provided me with the challenges he faces on the job. Interestingly,
the first thing he mentions is the unrealistic requests and expectations of
customers. He exclaimed: “I feel as though some customers perceive us as gods,
able to carry out any given task, regardless of the practicality of the
request!”. In many circumstances, upper management would agree to very
ambitious ideas, forcing him and his team to find original technical solutions
to implement these ideas. However, management also tends to impose impossible
deadlines, forcing Mr. Phan’s crew to work overtime and enter “Crunch time”. “I
love thinking of new solutions to problems, but when we are forced into periods
of crunching, it’s a nightmare”, he said dauntingly, “your mind is always
thinking about coding and the problem, when you’re eating, resting or even
sleeping until you complete the project or burn out”. While this seems like a
perpetually stressful job, he also told me about very interesting traits of
this line of work: “When it comes to software development, there will be
periods that you would have to crunch 24/7, but when there are no active
projects, you are basically receiving your paycheck for free, doing practically
nothing, so things do tend to balance out in the end.”-
Mr. Phan was a very open person, and
thanks to him I have gained many valuable insights about the industry. This was
very educational and helped further fuelled my passion for the field.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><u></u>
